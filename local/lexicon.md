<h2>Book of Words</h2>

<h3>Info</h3>
<p>Nick Cave of the band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds kept a handwritten book of words in which he wrote down words he wanted to remember. Some photos of the book are available online to view, here is one of them:</p>

<p>I have always wanted to keep my own book of words, so this is me starting one I guess. Not much here yet but will build on it. Collected below will be words (And some phrases) I like, find interesting, have meaning or I might include them for some other reason. I may even use different fonts just to give the words some personality. We'll see how that goes. </p>

<p>I'm including any word I like. Not all of them may appear in the dictionary. </p>
