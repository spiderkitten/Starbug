<!-- Intro -->

## /Use

So this is just a page where I'm going to talk about what I use to get things done. Broken down into neat little sections, hopefully. Inspired by the /use movement I guess!   

<!-- Website Stuff -->

<div class="textbox">

### Website 

All the things I use to make this website! 

  - <a href="http://www.neocities.com">Neocities</a> - where this site is hosted. Its free, although there is a premium option. The uptime is amazing, and its perfectly suitable for a small personal page. Highly recommend!
  - <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> - what I use to write my code. Its a binary of Microsoft's VSCode - for all intents and purposes its the same app, just without the tracking/telemetry that Microsoft adds. 
  - <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions">Github Actions</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github">Github Pull Requests</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server">Live Preview</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> - extensions for VS Code. Live preview lets you see your page within VSCode, Live Server serves the page in your browser, and the github ones help with deploying to neocities. 
  - <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> - I deploy my site to Github and then it automatically deploys to neocities 
  - <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/blog/neocities-automatic-deployment">Deploy to Neocities</a> - tutorial on how to deploy to neocities from vscode

<!-- Browser Extensions -->

<div class="textbox">

### Browser + Extensions 

For browsing the internet I use <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a>, which to be honest I am not a huge fan of, especially its crypto enhancements, but I prefer it over every other chrome based browser. I chromecast a lot so I need a chrome based browser and Brave seems to be the better of the lot. 

Some of my favourite browser extensions are: 

### Blockers

- <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Ublock Origin</a> - to block ads everywhere  
- <a href="https://ublacklist.github.io/docs">Ublacklist</a> - to block sites showing up in search engine results 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone">SponsorBlock for Youtube</a> - this is a really cool addon where users submit start and end times of sections of youtube videos (intros, sponsor messages etc) to be blocked, and if you have the addon configured to block those things, then the video will just skip those sections. Its great to skip those "sponsored by squarespace/raid/nebula" bits, intros and outros, subscription/interaction reminders, etc There's a button to disable/enable so you can disable it on your favourite youtuber's videos.
- <a href="https://webextension.org/listing/block-site.html">Block Site</a> - this lets you block a site at the browser level, and you can add a password and a display message. I use it to block Dominos Pizza lol Its easy to bypass, but the extra step to get to the page, and the message displayed, forces me to rethink if I really want pizza or not 

### Re-Enables

- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/enable-right-click/hhojmcideegachlhfgfdhailpfhgknjm">Enable Right Click</a> - this enables right click on most pages that disable right click 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd">Selectable</a> - lets you select text on websites that have disabled it. I find this helpful when I am reading a long page of text, to highlight where I am up to. Places like fanficion.net disable text selection. This returns the ability. 

### Books

- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/goodreads-right-click/fbicpmopjallgdpklipffmihodimmcbe">Goodreads Right Click</a> - the lets you select the book name, then right click the text and it will search GoodReads.com. 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-ratings-imdbgoodread/cnjhjnjbpedipoamajojlbfakbadgiam">Hide Ratings</a> - this hides ratings bars and stars on GoodReads, IMDB, AnimeList and other sites. Configurable to choose where to hide them. I use it on GoodReads because I find the stars are usually not very accurate there and it colours my perception of books. 

### Reddit 

- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a> - a suite of tools that enhances Reddit - there are so many! Particularly useful are the filters. 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/display-reddit-images-nat/imiakeaigofbcfdjajmgjfnohjlekndg">Display Reddit images natively in browser</a> - this blocks Reddit from wrapping images with their preview pane, and instead just shows the image full screen. 

### Youtube  

- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-full-title-for-vi/pgpdaocammeipkkgaeelifgakbhjoiel?hl=en">YouTube Full Title For Videos</a> - See the full title of videos on the home and subscription pages 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-ad-accelerator-ea/lmcggcabhocpfkbddekmconplfjmmgmn">YouTube Ad Accelerator & Easy Speed Drag</a> - speed up youtube videos by up to 16x by clicking and dragging on the video 

### Other 

- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/water-reminder/kbcogmlnjaoecibenadekhkeelgdpmnb">Water Reminder</a> - configurable alarm to remind me to drink water every X minutes. Useful for other reminders too. 
- <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-image-as-png/nkokmeaibnajheohncaamjggkanfbphi?hl=en">Save Image As PNG</a> - save an image as a png instead of WebP
