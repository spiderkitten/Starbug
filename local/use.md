<!-- Intro -->

  <h2>/Use</h2>
    <p>So this is just a page where I'm going to talk about what I use to get things done. Broken down into neat little sections, hopefully. Inspired by the /use movement I guess! </p>

<!-- Website Stuff -->

<div class="textbox">
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>All the things I use to make this website!</p>

   <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.neocities.com">Neocities</a> - where this site is hosted. Its free, although there is a premium option. The uptime is amazing, and its perfectly suitable for a small personal page. Highly recommend!</li>

      <li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> - what I use to write my code. Its a binary of Microsoft's VSCode - for all intents and purposes its the same app, just without the tracking/telemetry that Microsoft adds. </li>

      <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions">Github Actions</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github">Github Pull Requests</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server">Live Preview</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> - extensions for VS Code. Live preview lets you see your page within VSCode, Live Server serves the page in your browser, and the github ones help with deploying to neocities.</li>

      <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> - I deploy my site to Github and then it automatically deploys to neocities</li>

      <li><a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/blog/neocities-automatic-deployment">Deploy to Neocities</a> - tutorial on how to deploy to neocities from vscode</li>
      </ul>

<!-- Browser Extensions -->

<div class="textbox">
<h3>Browser + Extensions</h3>
  <p>For browsing the internet I use <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a>, which to be honest I am not a huge fan of, especially its crypto enhancements, but I prefer it over every other chrome based browser. I chromecast a lot so I need a chrome based browser and Brave seems to be the better of the lot.</p>

   <p>Some of my favourite browser extensions are:</p>
<ul>
            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/enable-right-click/hhojmcideegachlhfgfdhailpfhgknjm">Enable Right Click</a> - this enables right click on pages that disable right click</li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/goodreads-right-click/fbicpmopjallgdpklipffmihodimmcbe">Goodreads Right Click</a> - the lets you right click selected text and search GoodReads.com. Handy if you come across a book and want to find it on goodreads. </li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-ratings-imdbgoodread/cnjhjnjbpedipoamajojlbfakbadgiam">Hide Ratings</a> - this hides ratings bars and stars on GoodReads, IMDB, AnimeList and other sites. Configurable to choose where to hide them. I use it on GoodReads because I find the stars are usually not very accurate there and it colours my perception of books.</li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a> - a suite of tools that enhances Reddit - there are so many! Particularly useful are the filters.</li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd">Selectable</a> - lets you select text on websites that have disabled it. I find this helpful when I am reading a long page of text, to highlight where I am up to. Places like fanficion.net disable text selection. This returns the ability.</li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/water-reminder/kbcogmlnjaoecibenadekhkeelgdpmnb">Water Reminder</a> - configurable alarm to remind me to drink water every X minutes.</li>

            <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone">SponsorBlock for Youtube</a> - this is a really cool addon where users submit start and end times of sections of youtube videos (intros, sponsor messages etc) to be blocked, and if you have the addon configured to block those things, then the video will just skip those sections. Its great to skip those "sponsored by squarespace/raid/nebula" bits, intros and outros, subscription reminders, etc There's a button to disable/enable so you can disable it on your favourite youtuber's videos.</li>
        </ul>
