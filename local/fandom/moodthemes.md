<h1>Mood Theme</h1>
<p>Mood Theme I made for use at livejournal, dreamwidth or any other site that supports it.</p>

<h2>Rules for Use</h2>
<p>You are free to use these anywhere, with the following caveat:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&#9733;</strong> Do not claim you made them!</li>
  <li><strong>&#9733;</strong> Save to your own computer, no hotlinking! </li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Info</h3>
<p><strong>Dreamwidth:</strong> Custom Moods are a Premium Only feature. Zip file contains all the images, and the code to use on Dreamwidth's <a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/admin/console/">admin console</a> or you can create the mood theme manually on the <a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/manage/moodthemes">custom mood theme page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Livejournal:</strong> Custom Moods are not a premium feature. Unfortunately though, Livejournal no longer allows access to the admin console, you will need to add the moods manually on the <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/manage/moodthemes.bml">custom mood theme page</a>.</p>
