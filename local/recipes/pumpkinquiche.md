<!-- Notes -->
<h3>Notes</h3>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>just mentioning this because it seems to matter: use a good thickened cream, the egg mix cooks a little loose and isn't as nice imo when you just use regular cream</li>
<li>I don't grease my dish, its pyrex and it doesn't seem to stick too much and its pretty easy to clean the dish after, if I am feeling lazy and want to avoid too much cleanup I will just use baking paper as a liner</li>
<li>I mix my eggs and cream right in the quiche dish to save on washing a bowl</li> 
<li>The amount of pumpkin, spinach, and tomatos doesn't matter. use as much or as little as you like</li>
<li>I use frozen chopped spinach - about 100g - I take it out of the freezer when I put the pumpkin on to cook and it thaws enough to use it 30 minutes later (but I'm in Australia and its pretty warm here, so your mileage may vary) you may want to squeeze excess water out using some paper towel</li>
<li>the pumpkin doesn't need to be fully cooked when you roast it because you are putting it in the quiche and putting it back in the oven for 35-40 minutes. you want it soft, but not cooked so much its starting to caramelise on the outside (unless you want it like that of course, in which case roast it a little longer)</li>
<li>I cook mine in a toaster oven, and it comes out perfect, but I do put a sheet of baking paper over the top as the paresan will burn if I don't</li>
</ul>
