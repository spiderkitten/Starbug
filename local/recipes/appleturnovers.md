<!-- Method -->
<h3>Method</h3>
<div class="method">
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to around 200C/400F </li>
<li>Cut each thawed pastry sheet down the middle and then cut each half into three to get 6 slices per sheet. 12 total. </li>
<li>score a border around the inside of each rectanlge with a butter knife. Use a fork to prick the inside rectangle all over. this stops the middle from rising.</li>
<li>mix the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
<li>spread the mix evenly over all 12 slices of pastry, in the middle rectangle over the fork pricks. leaving the border free from mix. there should be plenty of mix to be generous on each slice</li>
<li>spoon your apple pie filling on top of the cream cheese on each slice</li>
<li>cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<!-- Notes -->
<h3>Notes</h3>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Its easier if you put the pastry on the tray before you add the cream and apple</li>
<li>I cook mine in a toaster oven - four at a time - you may or may not need to adjust the temperature if you cook in a regular oven</li>
<li>If your oven runs hot or like me you are using a toaster oven you may need to place a piece of baking paper over the top while cooking to prevent the pastry from burning</li>
<li> You can brush the pastry with egg before cooking for a shinier pastry but I don't bother. </li>
<li>If you want them extra sugary sprinkle some icing (powdered) sugar on top after cooking</li>
<li>these are wonderful warm, but also quite good cold as a snack</li>
