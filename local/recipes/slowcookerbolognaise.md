<!--Ingredients List-->
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>I usually eyeball the ingredients and don't measure. So for this recipe I've listed approximately how much I usually put in, but feel free to adjust for your needs.</p>

<div class="ingredients">
<ul>
<li><strong>mince/ground beef</strong> - I'll use 100-200g grams</li>
<li><strong>diced tomato</strong> - I use 1 can</li>
<li><strong>diced onions</strong> - I usually use two smaller or one big one</li>
<li><strong>spinach</strong> - I use about 100g of frozen spinach</li>
<li><strong>sliced carrots</strong> - I use around 200g of frozen carrot strips</li>
<li><strong>broccoli rice</strong> - I fill the rest of the slow cooker up with it</li>
<li><strong>pasta sauce</strong> - just to thicken and add some colour</li>
<li><strong>garlic powder</strong> - I just shake it across the top</li>
<li><strong>italian herbs</strong> - I use a lid full</li>
<li><strong>Salt</strong> - just a quick shake</li>
</ul>

<!-- Notes -->
<h3>Notes</h3>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>I use frozen veggies. the carrots and spinach are store bought but I make and freeze the brocolli rice myself</li>
<li>to make brocolli rice, just put a head or two of fresh brocolli into a food processor for about 30 seconds to a minute or until riced. then put it in a freezer safe ziplock or container and freeze.</li>
</ul>
