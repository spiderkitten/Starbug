<!--Ingredients List-->
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>And by spicy I mean, faily mild lol</p>

<div class="ingredients">
<ul>
<li>Mince Meat (Ground Beef)</li>
<li>Frozen diced onion</li>
<li>Frozen red capsicum (bell pepper)</li>
<li>frozen spinach</li>
<li>frozen brocolli</li>
<li>1 packets of chow mein seasoning</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>the amounts don't really matter, the kind of vegies don't really either. just throw in however much you want of whatever you want. I usually use just eyeball it, and fill up the bowl with whatever I have.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<div class="method">
<ol>
<li>Throw everything except the brocolli in the slow cooker</li>
<li>add in the spice mix and mix it in</li>
<li>then add the brocolli on top (its easier to stir without the frozen brocolli)</li>
<li>Cover and leave to cook on high for around five hours</li>
</ol>

<!-- Notes -->
<h3>Notes</h3>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>If you are using a lot of frozen veg this may get liquidy so you may need to drain it a little. The liquid is tasty though so you could save it and put it in a soup or use it make a gravy or something.</li>
<li>Can served with rice, or just eaten as is.</li>
<li>Its also nice on a wrap with some lettuce and cheese but its messy this way.</li>
 
</ul>
