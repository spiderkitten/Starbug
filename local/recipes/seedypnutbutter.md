<!-- Notes -->
<h3>Notes</h3>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>To prevent overheating your food processor try blending for a short period, and then resting it for a minute or two to allow the moter to cool down a little.</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>You can use less peanuts, for a smaller amount of peanut butter, but you probably need to at least make sure there are enough peanuts to just cover the blades to ensure the process works.</li>
<li>In my experience 2.5 cups of peanuts makes around 500g of peanut butter.</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>It will take several minutes for the peanuts to get smooth. It will look like it isn't working but then it will magically get smooth. Usually the progress is: whole peanuts > crumbed > powdered > paste > ball > grainy smooth > smooth</li>
<li>Be careful not to over process or it will be a bit runny.</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>The colour of your peanut butter will depend on how dark the roasted peanuts are. Raw unroasted peanuts = pale peanut butter.</li>
<li>If you use salted peanuts you may not need to add salt, but taste the PB and see if it needs it.</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>You can always add a little sesame oil to the mix for an oiler PB or for taste. But the PB should be very smooth from the blending even without the oil.</li>
