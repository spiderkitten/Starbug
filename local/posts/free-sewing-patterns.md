### Sewing is expensive, am I right?

here are some free patterns from all over the internet to make various things, from plushies to bags to clothing and other items. None of them are my own patterns, although I do have some I may share at some point. 

I'll be updating this list over time. 


#### Plush Toys 

- [Felt Frogs](https://www.tumblr.com/boigameista/649758501526257664/aaa-ok-so-a-lot-of-people-have-been-asking-for-the) - tony felt frog pattern to sew
- [Scrabbles the Racoon plush](https://fluffmonger.net/2018/04/raccoon-free-sewing-pattern/) - cute racoon to sew

#### Clothing  

- [Easy Summer Shift](https://thislittlemiggy.com/2016/05/make-easy-summer-shift-tutorial/) simple summer dress - no pattern really needed  
- [Sam Apron](https://helensclosetpatterns.com/blogs/helens-closet/introducing-the-free-sam-apron-pattern) a really nice apron that includes plus sizes (sizes 0-34US (up to a 62” hip))
