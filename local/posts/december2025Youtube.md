**NYC Is Dumping One Billion Oysters Into Its Harbor—And It's Working"**

About the One Billion Oysters project in New York USA. The project is collecting oyster shells from restaurants, sun bleaching them dry, tumbling them to remove debris, and then using them to create oyster habitats that are seeded with baby oysters. The habitats are placed in the water around New York and they are actually restoring the biodiversity in the water! More oysters, but also fish and plant life are being restored. Its actually an amazing project. Oysters are remarkably good at cleaning water, they can filter a whole bathtubs worth of water in a day! Definitely worth a watch to see what this group is doing.
