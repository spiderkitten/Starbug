So, I found this questionnaire which was originally created by Mouseling.net (you can find it [here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)) and I thought I would try and answer some of the questions. 

I'm breaking it up into parts though, so its an easier read. 

<strong>This is Part 3 questions 21 - 30</strong>

<dl>
<dt><strong>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</strong></dt>
<dd>I like buttons, but have no opinion about banners. Buttons are a staple of personal pages, and I love seeing people's button walls. I think its great how some people can make a really cool peice of art fit into just 88x31 pixels!</dd>

<dt><strong>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</strong></dt>
<dd>I love them!</dd>

<dt><strong>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</strong></dt>
<dd>I'd probably make something different. I like to redo my site though - a change is as good as a holiday!</dd>

<dt><strong>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</strong></dt>
<dd>YES! there are some really great sites out there full of beautiful art, deep interesting content and sometimes even a combination of the two! I really love sites that are beautifully crafted and very individual.</dd>

<dt><strong>25. What text editor do you use?</strong></dt>
<dd>I use VS Codium, which is a fork of Visual Studio Code that doesn't have Microsoft's tracking in it</dd>

<dt><strong>26. Why do you use that one?</strong></dt>
<dd>see above - but also because its super easy to use and nice to have all my code neatly structured in folders and I can have a preview too using an extension.</dd>

<dt><strong>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</strong></dt>
<dd>within my neocities site yes. Im not sure why people use an external host for images...</dd>

<dt><strong>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</strong></dt>
<dd>I think it doesn't really matter which site you make your home at, either is fine. Nekoweb does have a few advantages imo, and I would probably move there if something happened with Neocities. But at the end of the day they both provide the same basic service mostly for free, so choose which one feels better for you!</dd>

<dt><strong>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</strong></dt>
<dd>Neocities tells you on your dashboard, mine uses around 120mb in total for storage and currently I use around 160mb of my monthly bandwidth quota</dd>

<dt><strong>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</strong></dt>
<dd>yes 100%, I actually make my site locally and then upload it (deployed via github actions using the neocities api) - but I always make a backup copy before I change anything big and I zip it up and store it both in a seperate folder, and in my dropbox. That way I always have a backup and if I need to revert back to a previous version - I can. </dd>
