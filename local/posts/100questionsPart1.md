So, I found this questionnaire which was originally created by Mouseling.net (you can find it [here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)) and I thought I would try and answer some of the questions. 

I'm breaking it up into parts though, so its an easier read. 

<strong>This is Part 1 questions 1 - 10</strong>


<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Please introduce yourself.</strong></dt>
<dd>
Hi, I am Starbug although I am known by other names in other places. I'm in my 50s and I live in Australia, about 2 hrs west of Sydney. 
</dd>

<dt><strong>2. How long have you been making websites?</strong></dt>
<dd>I made my first website in the mid 1990s, on Geocities! I made quite a few sites in the years after, on geocities, tripod, angelfire and later on my own domain, but from around 2005-2020 I made none. Its only been in recent years I have picked the hobby back up again. </dd>

<dt><strong>3. And what got you into the hobby?</strong></dt>
<dd>Back in the day it was just something fun to do, and a way to have somewhere to put my fanfic and other fannish things (before fanfiction dot net and AO3 ever existed!)</dd>

<dt><strong>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</strong></dt>
<dd>I like all kinds of sites, but the ones I like most are ones with content that interests me. Whether thats a shrine, a blog, tutorials or something else. I also really like ones that have interactivity - like a puzzle hunt or a draw box.</dd>

<dt><strong>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</strong></dt>
<dd>I design as I go mostly. I sometimes have vague ideas about what content I want, but design is never planned. </dd>

<dt><strong>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</strong></dt>
<dd>
I'll update this later
</dd>

<dt><strong>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</strong></dt>
<dd>Figuring out how to do something, (or figuring out why somethign is broken), and then getting it working! Its like a puzzle where you have to find the right pieces to go together. I'm more interested in that the design process I think.</dd>

<dt><strong>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</strong></dt>
<dd>art/graphics 100% - I can't draw to save my life (and don't have the patience to learn) and while I can replicate something following a tutorial, making my own art/graphics from scratch just never seems to look right. Thats why my site is fairly free of artwork.</dd>

<dt><strong>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</strong></dt>
<dd>I use the same general theme for all of my pages, I like it like that - I like it matchey matchey</dd>

<dt><strong>10. How confident are you with CSS?</strong></dt>
<dd>I would say fairly confident, there's always stuff I am learning though, when I first learned CSS was a long time ago and then I took a big break from making pages, and when I came back a lot of CSS was depreciated and there were lots of new easier ways to do thing. I had no idea what Flex or Grid was when I started making pages again. Nor what a variable was, but now I know! But there is always new CSS coming out and its fun to learn about that.</dd>
