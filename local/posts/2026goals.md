#### Contemplation

I've been thinking a lot about what goals I want to set myself for 2026 in terms of what I read and watch. 

#### Movies

I really enjoyed doing my A24 Challenge and while that is still somewhat going on I would love to do another challenge. 

I've been thinking of what I can do and so far have come up with:   

- Classic Film History: watching certain movies from certain decades that are considered film classics  

- A Year of GENRE: I pick a genre and deep dive into it looking at the classics of the genre and also the popular movies of the genre. I'm thinking maybe:  

  - a Sci-Fi subgenre
  - Westerns
  - Heist Movies

- Pick an actor or director and watch their entire body of work

Or maybe something else entirely. Still thinking about it. I need to pick something ASAP though! 


#### Reading 

2025 was such a reading slump year for me. I think I only read 4 books and 3 of them were manga volumes and the other was a novella. I'd like to read better in 2026 but I recognise I am still in a bit of a slump so I have been thinking about to resolve that. 

So far my options are:  

1. read books on my TBR list - I have cut the list down to around 15 books, so its very manageable and likely doable 

2. Start reading more classics - I've wanted to and I do enjoy some classics, but I am very very picky about my classics. My favourite is The Open Boat by Stephen Crane (although that is technically a short story I guess) but I have no interest in a lot of classics, you couldn't pay me to read most books on a list of "classics" - I greatly disliked Dracula for example, and Jane Eyre was tedious. Don't even get me started on Lord of the Rings (really not a fantasy or a historical reader) Even in genres I do like, its hard to find a classic I like. So I'm a bit eh about this option, but would still like to attempt it. 

3. Read one or two longer books - so I pick a really long book and just try to get that read this entire year. I tend to choose shorter novels when I am in a slump as they are easier to finish and get a sense of accomplishment. But there are a few book clubs online that are doing year long reads of some classic books and that could be a goal I guess. So far I know of:

- [A year long read of The Count of Monte Christo](https://www.reddit.com/r/AReadingOfMonteCristo/)  
- [A Year of Mythology's Mesopotamian & Egyption Reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/AYearOfMythology/comments/1pe0eyv/2026_mesopotamian_egyptian_reading_schedule/) (several books but they are longer ones)

I wish [The Hemmingway List](https://www.reddit.com/r/thehemingwaylist/new/) subreddit was still active, as I did actually make it part way through that a few years ago when they were spending the year reading Hemmingway's list of classics. I dipped when they got to Anna Karenina though as that was tooo much for me. I could probably read the list without the discussion though... hmm.  

But I really don't want to say "I'll read a bunch of classics" and then not read anything again, so I guess I will have a think about it. Maybe I could compromise and alternate a classic with a modern book?
