### /now November 2025  

loosley inspired by the /now page movement, a /now page is a page where you write about what you are up to "now" and so this is my version of it. 

What I am up to in November 2025

#### Watching the Toni and Ryan podcast 
Started watching the Toni and Ryan podast and I guess that makes me a TARPER (Toni and Ryan PodcastER). I find the show hilarious and find myself laughing at it all the time. Its an Aussie podcast hosted by Toni Lodge and Ryan Jon

#### BoxDivvy 
In an effort to save some money I joined one of my local BoxDivvy groups. I'm not sure if BoxDivvy is just an Australian thing or global, but how it works is you join your local group and then as a group you buy fruit and vegetables from BoxDivvy which buys direct from farmers - usually because you are buying in bulk the price is lower than buying from the supermarket. 

My experience so far has been mixed. Some weeks its a lot cheaper, but other weeks its about the same. Its only been more expensive once, and that was only because I pay extra for delivery. 

I'm not sure if I am going to continue with it or not yet, I'm still testing it out, but will try and stick with it till new year and then decide.

**The Real Reason Silent Film Actors Looked So Strange**

Good video about how early film actors needed to wear a rainbow of face makup in order to show up on early celular film. 

**A24's Midsommer - 10 Hours of Hårga Temple Burning Ambience**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHeSG0Q9x90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHeSG0Q9x90)  
What it says on the label, 10 hours of the Hårga Temple Burning. Something cozy for winter lol 


**Parajanov's Visual Masterpiece: "The Color of Pomegranates"**
