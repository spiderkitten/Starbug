### /now December 2025  

loosley inspired by the /now page movement, a /now page is a page where you write about what you are up to "now" and so this is my version of it. 

What I am up to in December 2025

#### Getting interested in Personal Curriculums  

I've watched a lot of videos about Personal Curriculums this month and I find it really interesting that people are setting up their own self education for different topics. Some people are going all out with courses and exams they are writing themselves and others are just letting their brain dictate how they do their learning. 

I'm going to try doing a subject or two of my own, but I will make a new post about it I think. 

#### Crossover

I bought Crossover - technically in november on Black Friday - but I only started using it in December. Crossover is an app (or more acurately a windows compatibility layer) that lets Mac and Linux users run windows only games and apps. Its basically Wine, but more user friendly with updates and patches to ensure games run. 

On Black Friday the price was around 75% off - so instead of it cosing AU$115 it only cost around AU$20. Bargain! 

And I am SO <rainbow-text>HAPPY</rainbow-text> WITH IT! 

For real, I have been able to play some great games using Crossover. Including my most favourite game ever, Team Fortress 2! Valve dropped Mac support for TF2 back when Steam dropped support for 32 bit games, so I haven't been able to play it since, but now I can and its made me ridiculously happy. 

I've also played Astroneer, and a few others. Really enjoying it. 

#### Powerwash Simulator

Powerwash Simulator was added to Apple Arcade in December, so I used a free month of Apple Arcade so I could play it. I love the game, played it a while back on XBox Cloud Gaming, and enjoyed playing it again on Apple Arcade. I will likely buy it on Steam as well when it goes on sale cheap enough and play it again on Steam via Crossover. 

But in December I played the heck out of it, because I do not want to renew Apple Arcade because there is very little on that I want to play.
