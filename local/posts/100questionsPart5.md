So, I found this questionnaire which was originally created by Mouseling.net (you can find it [here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)) and I thought I would try and answer some of the questions. 

I'm breaking it up into parts though, so its an easier read. 

<strong>This is Part 5 questions 41 - 50</strong>

<dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</strong></dt>
<dd>not really no, mostly use my phone</dd>

<dt><strong>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</strong></dt>
<dd>the only social media I use is Reddit and Youtube, I used to have a twitter account just to see content that was linked in various places but Twitter kept deleting my account and so I gave up</dd>

<dt><strong>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</strong></dt>
<dd>I do have a discord account and I belong to three or four communities but I almost never open it unless I need to check something</dd>

<dt><strong>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</strong></dt>
<dd>Nope, I usually have the tv on in the background though</dd>

<dt><strong>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</strong></dt>
<dd>I only have one site at the moment, I've thought about a second one, but I don't like the restrictions newer accounts have at neocities, so if I was going to make one it probably would not be at neocities.</dd>

<dt><strong>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</strong></dt>
<dd>many topics! I have lots more to add, I want my site to be bursting at the seams with different things lol </dd>

<dt><strong>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</strong></dt>
<dd>hmm thats a tough question, I think for the most part I present myself, but only like a fraction of myself, if that makes sense </dd>

<dt><strong>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</strong></dt>
<dd>nope, I mostly keep to myself I guess lol</dd>

<dt><strong>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</strong></dt>
<dd>to a point, yes. there are some things I wish were easier, or that worked a different way, but CSS is changing all the time, so who knows maybe someday those things will be improved!</dd>

<dt><strong>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</strong></dt>
<dd> oh, this may need a list! 

<ul>
<li>splash pages! unless you have something on your site that NEEDS a warning, I don't see the point of splash pages. Like, if you have a lot of adult content, violent content, or if you use a lot of image elements that may hurt people's eyes, then yes, please have a splash page. Otherwise, its just a hoop people have to click through to see your actual site</li>
<li>AUTOPLAYING MUSIC!!!!! sites with music that autoplays is a special kind of obnoxious imo. Please stop doing that. If you must autoplay music then have a button to turn the music off. Not everyone wants to hear music. I know I am often listening to other things when I visit sites and its disruptive to suddenly have random playing on top of that </li>
<li>designing an unresponsive page. so many people make sites that are not accessible on phones. And look, I get it. But more and more people access the internet via mobile devices so you're only losing page views by not making it responsive.</li>
<li>"Best viewed with..." everyone uses a different browser and one is no better than another.</li> 

at the end of the day, people at on your site because they want to look at it. design for all browsers! let them in, make it easy for people to look at your site no matter setup they have!
</ul>
