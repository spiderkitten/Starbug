So, I found this questionnaire which was originally created by Mouseling.net (you can find it [here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)) and I thought I would try and answer some of the questions. 

I'm breaking it up into parts though, so its an easier read. 

<strong>This is Part 2 questions 11 - 20</strong>


<dl>
<dt><strong>10. How confident are you with CSS?</strong></dt>
<dd>I would say fairly confident, there's always stuff I am learning though, when I first learned CSS was a long time ago and then I took a big break from making pages, and when I came back a lot of CSS was depreciated and there were lots of new easier ways to do thing. I had no idea what Flex or Grid was when I started making pages again. Nor what a variable was, but now I know! But there is always new CSS coming out and its fun to learn about that.</dd>

<dt><strong>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</strong></dt>
<dd>I do! Usually its for a description list, where dt is the name of the thing and dd is the description or definition - its not usually used to for questions and answers afaik (like it is for this questionnaire) but also not against the rules to do so! description lists can be useful for many things</dd>

<dt><strong>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</strong></dt>
<dd>I think maybe the link element - because it allows you to share other sites and resources with people!</dd>

<dt><strong>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</strong></dt>
<dd>I guess I think about what I want to be in the page, and how I want to format that. I'll make a basic template that is just a nav, main content, header and footer, and then go from there.</dd>

<dt><strong>14. Do you know JavaScript?</strong></dt>
<dd>Nooooooo, I don't - when I first learned html/css years ago javacript was barely a glint on the horizon and almost no one used it in their (personal) websites for many years - the popularity of using it in that context only happened after I stopped making sites in the early 2000s, and while I've tried to learn it a few times in the past couple of years I just don't get the logic in it, or the math. I think Im too old to learn now lol </dd>

<dt><strong>15. How about PHP?</strong></dt>
<dd>I know a tiny bit of php (mostly related to includes), but neocities doesn't support php so...</dd>

<dt><strong>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</strong></dt>
<dd>hmm not really? its just a personal site. I guess the theme is me? lol</dd>

<dt><strong>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</strong></dt>
<dd>content. I have been very slowly trying to add more content.</dd>

<dt><strong>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</strong></dt>
<dd>I do not. I have had some in the past though, and I am thinking about getting one in the future. Most names I come up with though are already taken or are for sale for some stupid high price by domain resellers</dd>

<dt><strong>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</strong></dt>
<dd>I don't really have an opinion either way. I think if you like the style of the old internet or retro sites and you want your site to look like that, then go for it, whatever floats your boat, its YOUR site to do whatever you choose. I'm not going to gatekeep web design. If you are happy with your site's design, then thats great! You're the only person whose opinion matters imo. </dd>

<dt><strong>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</strong></dt>
<dd>It is! and I do! Well, it is for the most part. the CSS was valid last time I checked, the html doesn't pass because I have some javacript that inserts code for a webring and THAT code isn't valid, but that is out of my control. Otherwise it passed the last time I checked. Although I do admit its been a while since I checked. I should do that soon.</dd>
