So, I found this questionnaire which was originally created by Mouseling.net (you can find it [here](https://mouseling.net/100webmaster)) and I thought I would try and answer some of the questions. 

I'm breaking it up into parts though, so its an easier read. 

<strong>This is Part 4 questions 31 - 40</strong>

<dt><strong>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</strong></dt>
<dd>that really depends on the design, but generally speaking I prefer simple</dd>

<dt><strong>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</strong></dt>
<dd>I do not, in fact my current layout which uses pinks, greens and reds is not like me at all lol</dd>

<dt><strong>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</strong></dt>
<dd>hmmm once or twice but its more to do with some bad apples in some communities, people who want to gatekeep things or who are rude to newbies. </dd>

<dt><strong>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</strong></dt>
<dd>this is mostly a solitary hobby for me, but I am generally a solitary person in general, not just for this hobby</dd>

<dt><strong>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</strong></dt>
<dd>my immediate family does, but no one else does</dd>

<dt><strong>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</strong></dt>
<dd>I update it randomly. I'll sometimes go weeks without updating, other times I'll update 5 times in one day. Depends on what I am working on and if I feel its a good point to upload or not</dd>

<dt><strong>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</strong></dt>
<dd>I used to change it quite often, because its fun to make sites, but my current layout I haven't changed in a while</dd>

<dt><strong>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</strong></dt>
<dd>I think its more me focused, but I would like to make it a bit less about me and more about other things, but that will happen with time</dd>

<dt><strong>39. Do you do web design professionally?</strong></dt>
<dd>Nope. I did want to at one point, back in the 90s/2000s. But not now. </dd>

<dt><strong>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</strong></dt>
<dd>I would not want to now. I'm also not going to talk about what I do for work.</dd>
