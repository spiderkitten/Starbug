### [Day 0]

<strong>Card Draw and Prompt:</strong> N/A 

I arrived at Aunt Em's farm today. Driving up the dusty road towards the farmhouse I wondered about how my life was about to change. I haven't seen Aunt Em since I was a kid, but when my parents told me how she needed help on the farm, I knew what I had to do. For this summer, anyway. There's still college in the fall. And to be fair, I know nothing about farming or homesteading. So I'm not sure how much help I will actuall be. This will definitely be a learning experience. 

Aunt Em greeted me with a smile, a hug, and a plate of warm oat cookies and I knew we would get along. She showed me to my room, and after I unpacked she gave me a tour of the homestead. It wasn't a huge farm compared to others in the region but was cute and cozy with chickens, ducks, and a few crops. 

After dinner she let me know what we'd be doing tommorow. After a really early start (4am, yikes!) we'll be milking the cows, feeding the chickens and collecting the eggs, and taking delivery of some goats. We'll need to get them into their new pen and fed. Then we'll start planning the new crop we'll be planting. Melons! I'm kind of excited to get started and looking forward to tommorow.
