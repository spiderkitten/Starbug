## Departure 
#### Notes

<strong>OOC</strong> I rolled two dice and got a 2 and 4. These gave me the prompts I am using below for day two. 

### Farewell Day 2

#### Reflections
**How do you wish you were more like your mentor?  
How are you glad to be different?**

If you had asked me a year ago if I was anything like Yarrow I would have laughed and given you a resounding NO. There's so many ways we are different. From the way we dress to the way we interact with people. 

I'm a very social person. I'll strike up a conversation with pretty much anyone that crosses my path. If I see you on my way to the shops I'll stop you and ask about your day. If we're sitting and waiting for the same bus I will talk your ear off. 

But Yarrow, Yarrow is not a talker. If she sees on her way to the shops she'll cross the road to avoid a conversation. If you try to start up a conversation with her, she'll give you one word answers, or grumble. She likes to keep to herself mostly. 

So in that way I am glad we are different. 

But. Yarrow has a quiet way about her. She observes. She's quiet because she is taking in her surroundings, and listening to the world. She hears the wind in the trees, and observes the flowers blooming. She notices if you are leaning a little to the left and prepares you a lotion to heal your foot. She hears the tremor in your voice when you are feeling sad and brews a potion to lift your spirits. 

In that way, I wish I was more like her. Maybe my time away will help me to think a little more like she does. 


#### Encounters
**You pay a visit to your oldest and best friend, for the last time in a
long while. What mischief or comfort do you indulge in together?  
~~What hopes do they share for your future?~~**

Soon.
