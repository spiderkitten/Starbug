## Departure 

#### Notes 
<strong>OOC (Out Of Character)</strong>: I was instructed to break the curse of perfection by making an intential mistake on my page, so I have done that in the word "name" below. Then I needed to replace words in the brackets with ones I chose from different sections in the manual. 

### About Me

Hi! \*waves\* 

My n*4*me is (Pog).    

I'm a sixteen-year-old witch-in-training (she/her), and when you first see me you'll probably notice my (messy hair), (toothy grin) and (stained fingers).   

I wear (moss-covered knitwear) and (garish dungarees) and carry (an old 35mm camera) with me pretty much everywhere.  

You'll probably also notice my familiar, (Opal). They're the (friendly)
(mink) that never leaves my side. Our bond is so strong that we can
even talk to each otherâ€”though you probably won't understand us!  

Most folks from my village would say I'm (helpful), I think. The people close to me make it clear that I should always be (curious).  

As for me, I think I'm (easy-going,) and I'd really like to be more (creative).

### My Story

I'm writing this from (Little Hook), the quiet little village I've lived in all my life.

I live here with, (Yarrow), the village witch. 

People in the village say she's (grumpy), but she can actually be (cheerful) when it's just us.

Since I decided to become a witch she's acted as my mentor, teaching
me the basics of the old ways. We've learned a lot together, but now it's
time for me to put it into practice on my own, far from her guiding hand.

Me and my familiar will be leaving on the next full moon, just two days
from now, to spend a year away. I hope to (stay true to my village traditions), but also want to (find out what a new culture can teach me).

When I dream about my new home, I wake up with lingering memories
of (a jumble of stalls spanning a creaking bridge) and (the restorative tang of
freshly-brewed tea).
