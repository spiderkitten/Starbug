<h1>Vampire Resource Management</h1>

<p>There's an interesting article over at <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com">Futility Closet</a> about Vampire Resource Management. A bunch of people have written papers about how long humanity would last if Vampires ever put in a concerted effort to feed on us. Spoiler alert: Its not long. Some other researchers discovered that if Vampires actually modelled a cyclical pattern of bloodsucking, they could keep humans alive indefinitely as a food source. </p>

<p>Well. I for one welcome our new Vampire Overlords. But isn't that super interesting! Its fascinating but also kind of terrifying. I love that there are people in the world who wrote papers about this.</p>

<p>I'm going to copy paste the important part of the article, in case the page ever goes missing because I love this! There's some links to the papers at the bottom if anyone wants to read them.</p>

<div class="basicbox">
<p style="font-style:italic">In 2006 physicists Costas Efthimiou and Sohang Gandhi worked out that if the first vampires had turned up in 1600, if they’d needed to feed only once a month, and if the world population at that time had been 536,870,911 (as estimated), then <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/977097/files/0608059.pdf">the vampire population would have increased geometrically</a> and the last human would have succumbed in June 1602, after a bloodbath of only two and half years.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">Worse, in 1982 a team of Austrian mathematicians led by R. Haiti and A. Mehlmann found that intelligent vampires could calculate a bloodsucking frequency that would <a href="https://www.rairo-ro.org/articles/ro/pdf/1982/04/ro1982160403791.pdf">maximize total utility per vampire</a> and keep the human race alive indefinitely — and solutions exist no matter whether they’re “asymptotically satiated vampires,” “blood-maximizing vampires,” or “unsatiable vampires.” </p>

<p style="font-style:italic">Later they expanded on this to show that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225866573_Cycles_of_fear_Periodic_bloodsucking_rates_for_vampires">cyclical bloodsucking patterns are optimal</a>.</p>
