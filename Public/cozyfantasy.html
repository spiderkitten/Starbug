  <h1>Cozy Fantasy & Sci-fi</h1>
  <p>I.. am not a huge fan of fantasy. But recently I have discovered the Cozy Fantasy subgenre and I have to say I am enjoying many books that fall into that category.</p>
  <p>I am a fan of Sci-Fi though and love the cozy sci-fi I have read. </p>

  <h2>So what is cozy fantasy & sci-fi?</h3>
  <p>This can vary from person to person, and a lot of the time defining something as Cozy is  based more on the intent of the novel, or the feeling a story gives you more than any defined elements of genre.</p>

  <p>For me, cozy Fantasy/Sci-fi novels are light, usually low stakes. They focus on found family, friendships, quiet life, the small moments in relationships.</p>
  <p>In the case of Sci-Fi they are generally hopeful. For fantasy, I do like a lot of stories where characters run cozy shops of all kinds.</p>

  <p>Some good places to find cozy fantasy recommendations are:</p>
