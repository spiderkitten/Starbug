<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>I've always wanted to try Roller Derby</li>
    <li>When I was in year 6 (6th grade), I won my school's book week costume contest. I was The Ghost of Christmas Past from A Christmas Carol. I wore a white sheet and carried some chains. Scary. lol</li>
    <li>My favourite alchohol drink is Gin and Elderberry</li>
    <li>My dream house is Gull Cottage from The Ghost and Mrs Muir (ghostly sea captain included). It doesn't have to be the exact house, just a cottage up on a cliffside overlooking a stormy rocky ocean. A lighthouse would work too.</li>

<!-- Anti-Bucket List -->
<h2>Anti-Bucket List</h2>
<div>
<p>Everyone seems to have a bucket list, but what about an anti-bucket list of things you never want to do or want to avoid at all costs? Here is mine, although right now its a bit short:</p>
</div>
<div class="stripedlist2">
<div>Spelunking</div> <div>I have been in a cave several times, nice big open caves like the ones at Jenolean Caves where you go on a guided walking tour and see the beautiful rock formations. Do I ever want to exploring a deep dark cave with climbing gear and descending into the ground via crawl spaces and abseiling down cliffs? HELL NO. I have seen too many "trapped in a cave" movies for that lol</div>
<div>Casu marzu/casgiu merzu</div><div>Its a type of edible rotting cheese that contains live maggots. That would be a great big NO for me.</div>

<div>Visit DisneyLand/World</div><div>I have never wanted to go to Disney, even as a child. Nothing has changed my mind on that. Its not even the cost or the wait times (though that would be reason enough), I have just never found it interesting enough to want to go there I guess.</div>
