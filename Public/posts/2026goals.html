<h3>2026 Goals</h3>

<div><strong>December 28, 2025</strong></div>

<h4>Contemplation</h4>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about what goals I want to set myself for 2026 in terms of what I read and watch.</p>
<h4>Movies</h4>
<p>I really enjoyed doing my A24 Challenge and while that is still somewhat going on I would love to do another challenge.</p>
<p>I've been thinking of what I can do and so far have come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic Film History: watching certain movies from certain decades that are considered film classics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Year of GENRE: I pick a genre and deep dive into it looking at the classics of the genre and also the popular movies of the genre. I'm thinking maybe:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Sci-Fi subgenre</li>
<li>Westerns</li>
<li>Heist Movies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick an actor or director and watch their entire body of work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe something else entirely. Still thinking about it. I need to pick something ASAP though!</p>
<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>2025 was such a reading slump year for me. I think I only read 4 books and 3 of them were manga volumes and the other was a novella. I'd like to read better in 2026 but I recognise I am still in a bit of a slump so I have been thinking about to resolve that.</p>
<p>So far my options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>read books on my TBR list - I have cut the list down to around 15 books, so its very manageable and likely doable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start reading more classics - I've wanted to and I do enjoy some classics, but I am very very picky about my classics. My favourite is The Open Boat by Stephen Crane (although that is technically a short story I guess) but I have no interest in a lot of classics, you couldn't pay me to read most books on a list of &quot;classics&quot; - I greatly disliked Dracula for example, and Jane Eyre was tedious. Don't even get me started on Lord of the Rings (really not a fantasy or a historical reader) Even in genres I do like, its hard to find a classic I like. So I'm a bit eh about this option, but would still like to attempt it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read one or two longer books - so I pick a really long book and just try to get that read this entire year. I tend to choose shorter novels when I am in a slump as they are easier to finish and get a sense of accomplishment. But there are a few book clubs online that are doing year long reads of some classic books and that could be a goal I guess. So far I know of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AReadingOfMonteCristo/">A year long read of The Count of Monte Christo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AYearOfMythology/comments/1pe0eyv/2026_mesopotamian_egyptian_reading_schedule/">A Year of Mythology's Mesopotamian &amp; Egyption Reading</a> (several books but they are longer ones)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thehemingwaylist/new/">The Hemmingway List</a> subreddit was still active, as I did actually make it part way through that a few years ago when they were spending the year reading Hemmingway's list of classics. I dipped when they got to Anna Karenina though as that was tooo much for me. I could probably read the list without the discussion though... hmm.</p>
<p>But I really don't want to say &quot;I'll read a bunch of classics&quot; and then not read anything again, so I guess I will have a think about it. Maybe I could compromise and alternate a classic with a modern book?</p>
