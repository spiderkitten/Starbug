<h1>Changelog</h1>
<p>Just a way to look back on all the updates I have made. Should be every major update.</p>

      <h2>2024 Updates</h2>
      <div class="updatebox">

        <p>
          <strong>3rd September 2024:</strong> added a lexicon/book of words with some cool words that I like in it. Fixed a few things behind the scenes.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>25 August 2024:</strong> Livejournal/Dreamwidth stuff: Added a 100x100 icon archive of the icons I have made over the years, a page of friends only banners, and a mood theme.  
          </p>

        <p>
          <strong>19 August 2024:</strong> New layout! changed the guestbook to atabook, added a page about Vampire Resource Management, fixed a bunch of things.
        </p>

      <p>
        <strong>24 July 2024:</strong> Finished my A24 (movie stuff) page. Updated the 'What I use (about) page. Updated
        the links page. Added a Cozy Fantasy/Sci-Fi page (book stuff).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>13 June 2024:</strong> Completely redid the site so it looks prettier. Added a gingham background (css)
        and some pics, redid the layout. Looks much better now imo! Also working on a few pages that are not complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>23 May 2024</strong>: Updated the menu to be expandable. Added a shrine section. No content yet though!
        Added a commonplace book. But also not much content there yet. Added a blog, which is an RSS feed of my
        dreamwidth journal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>17 May 2024</strong>: Added my 1990s website history. Its not complete, but its a start. Also updated
        some links in the nav menu. And I added a guestbook..
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14 May 2024</strong>: So I guess this is a big update because I
        redid the entire site. IT'S <span class="rainbow-text">BRAND SPANKING NEW, BABY</span>. Heck yeah. I'm
        still working on some pages, so there may some dead links in the menu.
      </p>
