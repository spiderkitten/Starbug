<p>I have always wanted to keep my own book of words, so this is me starting one I guess. Not much here yet but will build on it. Collected below will be words (And some phrases) I like, find interesting, have meaning or I might include them for some other reason. I may even use different fonts just to give the words some personality. We'll see how that goes. </p>
