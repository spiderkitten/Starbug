<h2>Departure</h2>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><strong>OOC</strong> I rolled two dice and got a 5 and 3. These gave me the prompts I am using below for day one.</p>
<h3>Farewell - Day 1</h3>
<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p><strong>What stress dream do you keep having about leaving home?</strong><br>
<strong>What anxiety about the journey still troubles you when awake?</strong></p>
<p>I must admit I am a little anxious about leaving home.</p>
<p>I'm worried that I won't learn enough to help the people at home. Yarrow is getting older, and I fear her days with us are numbered, so I want to learn all I can. But what if I don't succeed? Yarrow told me I am being silly, that I have a strong mind and will do well and I want to believe her.</p>
<p>But sometimes at night have strange dreams. I dream I return to the village and Yarrow has passed, a great disaster befalls the town and I am unable to help. My mouth fuses shut and my fingers curl up into my palm, and I am rendered unable to cast any kind of spell.</p>
<p>It worries me that the dream may be prophetic but Yarrow says that no one in my family has that ability, that its just anxiety.</p>
<p>I hope she is right.</p>
<h4>Encounters</h4>
<p><strong>One of your family members, not magical at all, asks you for help
with their work. Do they labour with their hands, or do something
more academic? As you work, what advice do they share?</strong></p>
<p>My cousin, May, asked for my help today with the washing the bedding. We filled large tubs with hot water from the fire place, and scrubbed the sheets against the scrubboard. It was hard work, hot and heavy. It took us all morning, but by lunchtime the sheets were hung to dry in the sunlight and were flapping gently in the breeze. I'm always trying to convince her to get a washine machine, but she insists the sheets feel cleaner this way.</p>
<p>May invited me inside for lunch, and she cut us thick slices of warm, freah out of the oven bread, then spread them with lashings of butter and honey from her hives. It was so good! After we sat on her huge comfy couch in the living room, and drank tea.</p>
<p>You wouldn't know it but May and I are around the same age. She's just a year or two older than me.  When we were kids we were almost inseperable. But then a year or so ago her mother, my Aunt, died. It became May's responsibility to run the house, and she no longer had time to wander the fields with me, pick berries, or swim in the lake. Instead she learned to cook, take in washing to help support the family, and with her father always working, is practically raising her brothers and sisters on her own.</p>
<p>We sat sipping our tea in a comfortable silence. I think May could tell something was bothering me, as she placed her tea on the table, took my hand and asked me what was up. I mentioned my anxiety over leaving and my fear of failure, and she took a moment to think before speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Pog, of the two of us you were always the bravest one.</p>
<p>I know that once you arrive at your destination, you will embrace everything that's thrown at you.</p>
<p>Because you love helping people, even when we were little you always found a way to help people when they needed it. You helped me most of all. So my advice is to learn everything you can so that soak up all that knowledge so that when you come home you'll have the knowledge and ability to apply it in most circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, be off with you, I am sure you have packing to do and other people to visit. But pop back tommorow morning, I have some goodies to send you off with.&quot;</p>
