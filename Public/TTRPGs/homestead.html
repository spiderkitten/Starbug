<strong>Cost:</strong> Name your own price ($2 recommended)<br>
<strong>Time Needed</strong> ongoing
<strong>Premise:</strong><br>
&quot;Take on the life of a homesteader and craft a story&quot;</p>
<p><strong>OOC:</strong> Gameplay = Draw a playing card, match it to a table to find what your day entails. Make a journal entry. Repeat for each day. Game is open ended.</p>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
<p><strong>Homestead Name:</strong> Sunnybrook<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Plains (rolled 3)<br>
<strong>Skill:</strong> Hunting (rolled 2)<br>
<strong>Starting Crop:</strong> Melons (rolled 5)<br>
<strong>Starting Animal:</strong> Goats (rolled 3)</p>
<h3>[Day 0]</h3>
<p><strong>Card Draw and Prompt:</strong> N/A</p>
<p>So yesterday I got some terrible news and maybe some good news.</p>
<p>A letter came from a solicitor letting me know that my Aunt passed away. This is distressing news to say the least, but largely because...</p>
<p>I didn't know I had an Aunt.</p>
<p>Which is something to ponder later I guess. The letter went on to tell me that as her only living relative, I have inherited her estate, which includes: &quot;Sunnybrook&quot; - a small hobby farm, &quot;Farmers Pick&quot; - a small shop in town, and also various assorted other items.</p>
<p>I'm driving down to the farm tommorow to take posession and signed all the paperwork. I'll probably stay the weekend, to check the farm and shop out, see what there is and what I need to take care of right away, and head back on monday.</p>
<h3>[Day 1]</h3>
<p><strong>Card draw and prompt:</strong> 7 Spades - One of your animals give birth</p>
<p>Today was both exciting and kinda scary!</p>
<p>I arrived at the farm, met the solicitor and signed all the paperwork. Then he introduced me to Ryn, the farm manager, and left me in her capable hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't think Ryn likes me much.</p>
<p>It wasn't that she rude per se, she just didn't really have the patience for all my questions I guess.</p>
<p>She drove me around the farm, showed me all the fields and the animals, and then took me back to the farmhouse for lunch. Turns out I employ a cook! Martha was bustling around the kitchen when we entered, and she took one look at me and said I needed to be fed, and before I could argue I had a full plate placed on the table in front of me.</p>
<p>That was when Ryn's walkie squawcked. It was one of the farmhands, apparently one of the goats was giving birth! We headed out to the goat pen, and spent the rest of the day birthing twin goats. WOW. I've never seen a goat give birth. Or any animal give birth actually. It was so beautiful. But also a little gross lol</p>
<p>I asked about naming them but Ryn just rolled her eyes and muttered something about city slickers. Apprently we don't name farm animals, which was dissapointing, but I guess I understand the why. Don't want to get too attached to something that won't be staying. Still, I wish I could have named them, just this once.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm super tired after all the excitement so I'm going to bed soon. Ryn gave me my Aunt's room. Its a little weird being in here, but the other rooms are taken. Ryn lives in the farmhouse, Martha too. I'm only staying a few days, so its all good.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have some more questions for Ryn tommorow about what happens going forward with my Aunt no longer running the farm.</p>
<p>But for tonight, time for bed.</p>
<h3>[Day 2]</h3>
<p>Soon</p>
