<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>(Dice Roll = 2) On a doorstep</p>
<h4>Mini Fic</h4>
<p>Felix got home from the park and noticed a small white envelope on the doorstep. Closing his umbrella, he shook it out, then carefully checked the envelope for the sender and noticed it was from his best friend Robbie, who was currently away at summer camp. Excitedly he tore open the envelope. Inside was a simple card that read, &quot;You are Invited to attend Family Day at Burrow Summer Camp&quot; Big fat drops of rain landed on the card but Felix barely noticed, he was going to visit his friend! he could hardly wait!</p>

<h4>What are you delivering?</h4>
<p>(Dice Roll = 5) A Postcard</p>
<h4>How Do You Deliver It?</h4>
<p>(Dice Roll = 2) In a tiny mailbox</p>
<h4>Mini Fic</h4>
<p>Barry closed the door to his garden shed. He'd spent all day working in his garden, unpotting some plants and planting in the new garden bad he had made, weeding the back garden, and watering all his flowers. And now it was starting to storm. The smell of petrichor followed him around the side of the hosue to the front garden as the storm clouds gathered. Noticing the red flag was raised on his mailbox Barry detoured to the mailbox and pulled out a small rectanglur piece of card. It was a postcard! On the front was a photo of a spectacular looking garden. The reverse has a handwritten message:</p>
<p>&quot;The gardens here are spectacular! Not as lovely as yours though, Barry. Can't wait to get back and show you all the photos! Love, your sister Bonnie.&quot;</p>

<h4>How Many Letters Left in Bag:</h4>
<p>One</p>
<h4>Who is the second letter for?</h4>
<p>(Dice Roll = 3)  A pair of geese awaiting the arrival of their first gosling</p>
<h4>What are you delivering?</h4>
<p>(Dice Roll = 4)  A Thankyou Note</p>
<h4>How Do You Deliver It?</h4>
<p>(Dice Roll = 5) Handed directly to them</p>
<h4>Mini Fic</h4>
<p>Garry and Glenda swimming in their front pool when I arrived with their mail. They didn't seem bothered by the storm so I called out that mail was here. The two of them quickly waddled over to the fence and I handed them the letter. Glenda carefully opened the envelop and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. Opening it she read for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, its from Macy, she's thanking us for spending time with her last week.&quot;</p>
<p>Garry looked at me and explained &quot;Macy needed some help around the house with the little ones, and since we're expecting our own we thought it would be good practice.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled. Glenda was due any day now, I'm sure the practice was helpful.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, you should head home before the storm really gets bad!&quot; They waved as they headed back to their pool. I waved back and checked my bag to see who the next person to deliver to was.</p>

<h4>How Many Letters Left in Bag:</h4>
<p>None!</p>
<h4>Mini Fic</h4>
<p>Find no mail left in my bag, I slowly made my way back to the post office, happy that the mail had been delivered and that it had bought joy to everyone.</p>
